 Peer-graded-Assignment-Course-Project-Shiny-Application-and-Reproducible-Pitch

This repository has the ui.R and server.R files for the first part of the Developing Data Products Course Project. The peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, we need to create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, we should use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about the application.

The first part of the assignment to create a Shiny application can be found here:

The presentation is available at:
